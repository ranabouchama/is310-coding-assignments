    <h1>The Food Timeline</h1>
    <p>The Food Timeline began as a series of books chronicling the history of food, and specifically recipes. Beginning from 17,000 BC and ending with the modern day (specifically 2013). It was later digitized by its author Lynne Oliver before being bought by Virginia Tech</p>
